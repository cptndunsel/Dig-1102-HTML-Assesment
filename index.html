    <p>My name is David Boell, and I am a twenty seven year old Web Development student. I am currently attending
        Valencia Community College in order to get an A.S. degree in Digital Media Technology. I am hoping to graduate
        by Fall 2023, and afterwards I am hoping to put my education to work by pursuing a career as a front-end web
        developer.</p>
